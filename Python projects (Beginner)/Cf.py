#Calculator prototype 2!
#This time its a bit more complicated
#The reason for this is cause I will be using functions
#If you feel that there is a need to improve, please do say so
#Anyways lets begin:

#First we will be making the main functions for the operations
#It is important to remember that if you want to PRINT a function you must add a return value,
#Otherwise, it will simply print "None"
def multi(a , b):
    return a * b

def divi(a , b):
    return a / b

def add(a , b):
    return a + b

def sub(a , b):
    return a - b
#As you may notice, these may not be very complex, but they help us make the code easier to read and
#easier to use
"""
I will now demonstrate a way in which we can avoid writing too many lines of code by writing alot of functions,
this is with the "import" feature which will help us write all of our functions on one document, while being able
to use them on another, please go to Calcu_2
