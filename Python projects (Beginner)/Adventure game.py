#This is going to be a simple choose your adventure game that uses text
#Since this is a simple game we will use alot of if statements.
#In the future I will use a gui or pygame to visualize the game and make it better
#Side note: The documentation for the game (Story, settings, theme, etc.) will be on a seperate document
